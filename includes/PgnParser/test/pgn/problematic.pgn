{In my preparation to this tournament, I (and probably everybody else) paid the most serious attention to two openingsx Ruy Lopez with Bc5 and Najdorf, since most of the participants seem to play them both. Needless to say, refuting Najdorf is tough, but I thought I came close to refuting Ruy Lopez with 5...b5 and 6...Bc5, provided Black responded to 7.a4 with 7...Rb8. But the opening ceremony dealt a heavy blow to mex I was the last one to play Shirov with White. And indeed, in Rounds 7&8 Shirov faced the position after 7.a4 against Kasparov & Anand. But to my relief, he must have thought that these guys know something and replied 7...Bb7. I was still in business.}

{Novelty which, in my opinion, almost kills the entire line. Kasparov, however, seemed to be sceptical. During the closing ceremony he asked me a couple of questions concerning the game, and then remarked that he would do a far better job as White if he was given a chance. It remains a mystery whether his improvement over my play was before or after move 15. Anand, on the other hand, is rumoured to have prepared the same stuff. } (15.Be3 Qf6 16.Kh1 exd4 17.cxd4 Ba5 $1 18.Rg1 Rxb5 19.Ba4 Rxb2 20.Bxc6 Bb6) { was played in Ivanchuk-Shirov.

{Queens' Gambit Declined, 26 moves. Capablanca gets an advantage out of the opening. Just when Spielmann finds a move that appears to hold everything together, Capablanca makes a brilliant piece sacrifice. Capablanca was world champion from 1921-1927.}

ways.  Should Black ever play Nxe5, White will
recapture with the Bishop Pawn and open his King
Bishop file. The White's King Bishop Pawn may later
in the game advance to f5, threatening to break up
Black's kingside by f6. White's King Rook now can

diagonal and exchanges off his King Bishop. Each
exchange favors Black, for they lessen the vigor of a

Knight at e4, and as long as it remains there it is
more effective than the Bishop, whose diagonal itblocks.}
 18...dxe4
19. Qg3 {Black is not the only one who has gained
something from these exchanges. Now that Black's
Queen Bishop Pawn no longer has the support of a
Queen Pawn, he is much less free to advance his queen
side pawns, and his attack on the queen side is thus
slowed.  White's backward King Pawn, which previously
was indirectly under  pressure by Black's King Rook,
now has shelter behind Black's Pawn at the latter
e4.} 19...f6 {This slightly weakens Black's

Bishop Pawn from ever advancing to f6.}

that after Tarasch made his 38th move, "The
spectators began to drift away, thinking there was
nothing more to see." But now comes one of the most
dramatic surprises ever seen on a chessboard. With
hindsight, several annotators have advocated that
black play 38.. Rxb3, which sacrifices the exchange
for a pawn. Black would then have his Bishop
available for the defense and obtain two dangerous
connected passed pawns. But 38...Rxb3 is no better
